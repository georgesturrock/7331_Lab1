**Grading Rubric**

*Business Understanding (10 points total)*
* Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why was this data collected in
the first place?). Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the
dataset. That is, why is this data important and how do you know if you have mined
useful knowledge from the dataset? How would you measure the effectiveness of a
good prediction algorithm? Be specific.

*Data Understanding (80 points total)*
* [10 points] Describe the meaning and type of data (scale, values, etc.) for each
attribute in the data file.
* [15 points] Verify data quality: Explain any missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
Are those mistakes? How do you deal with these problems? Give justifications for your
methods.
* [10 points] Visualize appropriate statistics (e.g., range, mode, mean, median, variance,
counts) for a subset of attributes. Describe anything meaningful you found from this or if
you found something potentially interesting. Note: You can also use data from other
sources for comparison. Explain why the statistics run are meaningful.
* [15 points] Visualize the most interesting attributes (at least 5 attributes, your opinion
on what is interesting). Important: Interpret the implications for each
visualization. Explain for each attribute why the chosen visualization is appropriate.
* [15 points] Visualize relationships between attributes: Look at the attributes via scatter
plots, correlation, cross-tabulation, group-wise averages, etc. as appropriate. Explain
any interesting relationships.
* [10 points] Identify and explain interesting relationships between features and the class
you are trying to predict (i.e., relationships with variables and the target classification).
* [5 points] Are there other features that could be added to the data or created from
existing features? Which ones?

*Exceptional Work (10 points total)*
* You have free reign to provide additional analyses.
* One idea: implement dimensionality reduction, then visualize and interpret the results.
