    "Since its inception, statistical data analysis has been an integral part of the game.  Coaches, players, and baseball fans can\n",
    "recite many of these stats and often use them in coaching and team roster development decisions.  Books and movies have been based on the pursuit of utilizing baseball statistics to build the ultimate baseball team. They have even coined the term Sabermetrics: The empirical analysis of baseball, especially baseball statistics that measure in-game activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book; Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis and a film based on the book, staring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, are about Billy Bean, General Manager of the Oakland Athletics who focuses on player/team Sabermetrics to assemble a competitive baseball team using limited funding during the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Billy Bean was able to field a competitive team with a salary budget of less than half of their larger markets competitors, by focusing on hiring undervalued players.  Despite the salary roadblock, the Athletics made the playoffs in 2002 & 2003.\n",

    "The source of baseball data for this lab is the Sean Lahman Baseball Database [\n",
    "http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/].  Often cited as the most complete baseball database, the data set includes twenty-seven data tables and millions of records covering most non-proprietary baseball data pertaining to offense, fielding, pitching, payroll, player demographics, team statistics, manager data and much more.  For this lab, the focus will be on team level data.  The team level data will be explored using graphical analysis using standard python libraries.  After data exploration is complete, statistical methods can be employed to determine variable correlation and/or outcome prediction using techniques such as principle component analysis (PCA) or logistic regression.  Predictive models will be verified to assure the output is useful.  For example, a logistic regression model will have its assumptions validated, competing models will be compared using best practice measurements such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), Specificity, Sensitivity and Misclassification Scores.  The outcomes of this study could provide helpful insights for baseball fans who play fantasy sports, baseball reporters and baseball managers to assist with building a more competitive team.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The base team data from the Lahman baseball database contains forty-eight different attributes.  The team level data begins with the 1871 season and contains team level data thorugh the conclusion of the 2017 major league baseball season.  The grain of the team data is at the season and team level.  The attributes can be divided into three general categories:  informational, offense and pitching.  Informational attributes are descriptive elements about the team.  These include unique team identifiers, league membership, division membership, post-season success indicators and home ballpark information.  Convential team offensive statistics such as total hits, at bats and home runs are also present.  Team Pitching statitistics such as earned run average (ERA), saves and strikeouts are available for analysis as well.  "

That said the data will be examined for missing values, unique identifiers, consistency between team names over time and any other anomalies which may arise.  The data will be subset only those records from 1970 and forward.  Professional baseball has grown tremendously since 1871.  The merger of the American League and the National League, the introduction of divisions, teams have gone out of business, new teams have been created, wild card playoffs, and evolving strategy makes data from approximatley 150 years ago likely to be too dated to be useful.  Data quality analysis will be conducted on this subset of the team data. "

This is to be expected as these are binary indicators.  Missing values in these columns will be examined later in this section.  Alternatively, there are no columns where each row contains a different value.  The attendance column contain a large number of unique values.  This is to be expected as attendance can realisticaly be as low as a five digit integer and as high as a six digit integer.  In summary, there are no issues with regards to non-uniquenes or over-uniqueness in the subset team data set.  "
