    "The base team data from the Lahman baseball database contains forty-eight different attributes.  The grain of the team data is at the season and team level.  The attributes can be divided into three general categories:  informational, offense and pitching.  Informational attributes are descriptive elements about the team.  These include unique team identifiers, league membership, division membership, post-season success indicators and home ballpark information.  Convential team offensive statistics such as total hits, at bats and home runs are also present.  Team Pitching statitistics such as earned run average (ERA), saves and strikeouts are available for analysis as well.  "
